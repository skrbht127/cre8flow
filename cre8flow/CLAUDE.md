## Context Navigation (Wiki-Brain)

You have access to a personal wiki at `D:\Desktop\sarkar`. This is the user's
compounding knowledge base. Use it as your primary context source.

When you need to understand the codebase, docs, past work, or any stored
knowledge:

1. **ALWAYS query the knowledge graph first:** `graphify query "your question"`
   (run from `D:\Desktop\sarkar`).
2. **Use `D:\Desktop\sarkar\wiki\index.md`** as your navigation entrypoint for
   browsing the wiki structure.
3. **Use `D:\Desktop\sarkar/graphify-out/wiki/index.md`** if it exists — it's
   the auto‑generated Graphify wiki index.
4. **Only read raw files in `D:\Desktop\sarkar\raw\`** if the user explicitly
   says “read the raw file” or the graph query doesn’t have the answer.

## Wiki‑Brain Session Rules

**Ingesting sources.** When the user drops a file into `D:\Desktop\sarkar\raw\`
and asks you to ingest it, follow `/wiki-brain ingest` — read the source,
summarize, create/update wiki pages, cross‑link aggressively, update
`wiki/index.md`, append to `log.md`.

**Every session must end with a log entry.** Before ending a session, append
one line to `D:\Desktop\sarkar\log.md` in this exact format:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] session | <3-8 word session title>
Touched: <comma‑separated wiki pages, or "none">
```

**If the session produced durable knowledge** (decisions made, things learned,
project state changed, problems solved) — update or create relevant wiki pages
with that knowledge before ending. Cross‑link with `[[Page Name]]`.
Update `wiki/index.md`.

**If the session was trivial** (one‑off fix, routine task, exploratory
chatter) — skip the wiki update. Just append the log line.

**Never modify files in `raw/`.** Sources are immutable.
**Claude owns `wiki/` entirely.** Update it, don’t ask permission for each
page — just report what changed.
**Always update `wiki/index.md`** when you create or rename a wiki page.
**Cross‑link aggressively.** `[[Page Name]]` Obsidian syntax. A page with
no inbound links is a dead‑end.
